# Sudoku
You can just enter a Sudoku and this web page will solve it.    <br />
I am using a backtracking algorithm to solve the sudoku.<br />
First, I attempted to solve a 4x4 Sudoku in Python - Refer to "Sudoku 4x4.py" <br />
Then,  I solve 9x9 Sudoku using Backtracking in Python - Refer to "Sudoku 9x9.py"<br />
Finally, I converted it to Typescript to host it online - Refer to "\src\app\grid\grid.component"<br />
